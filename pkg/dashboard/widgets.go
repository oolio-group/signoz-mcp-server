Conceptual guidance only: WHICH query type and panel type to choose, and how to think about legends and layout. For the exact JSON shape (the panels map, plugin 'kind's, layouts, and variables), see signoz://dashboard/instructions and the create/update tool's JSON Schema.

Query Type Selection [CRITICAL]:
Choose the appropriate query type based on your data source and requirements:

1. Query Builder (Recommended):
   - Use for: Most common use cases with logs, traces, and metrics
   - Best for: Filtering, aggregation, grouping with UI-driven query construction
   - Advantages: Auto-completion, validation, easier to maintain, supports trace operators
   - Supports: All signal types (logs, traces, metrics)
   - When to use: Default choice unless you need advanced SQL features or PromQL-specific functions

2. ClickHouse SQL:
   - Use for: Advanced queries requiring complex SQL operations
   - Best for: Custom aggregations, window functions, CTEs, joins, histogram quantiles, rate calculations
   - Advantages: Full SQL power, complex transformations, performance optimization
   - Supports: Logs, traces, metrics (via different schemas)
   - When to use: Query Builder limitations, complex calculations, custom time bucketing, advanced filtering
   - Required: Must reference appropriate schema (logs/metrics/traces) and examples

3. PromQL:
   - Use for: Metrics queries with Prometheus-style syntax
   - Best for: Rate calculations, range queries, aggregations over time, histogram quantiles
   - Advantages: Familiar to Prometheus users, concise for time-series operations
   - Supports: Metrics only
   - When to use: Prometheus migration, metric-specific operations, OpenTelemetry metrics with dots in names
   - Required: Must follow new format syntax (wrap metric names in curly braces, quote names with dots)
   - Reference: Read signoz://promql/instructions, which covers the Prometheus 3.x UTF-8 quoted-selector form for dotted OTel names, anti-pattern table, dotted labels in by()/on()/ignoring(), and common patterns by metric type.

Selection Guidelines:
- Start with Query Builder for simplicity and maintainability
- Use ClickHouse SQL when you need: CTEs, window functions, complex joins, custom bucketing, advanced rate calculations
- Use PromQL when you need: Prometheus compatibility, metric-specific functions, range vector operations
- Avoid mixing query types within a single dashboard unless necessary for specific requirements

Query Resources [REQUIRED]:
- Query Builder: signoz://dashboard/query-builder-example
- ClickHouse logs: signoz://dashboard/clickhouse-schema-for-logs and signoz://dashboard/clickhouse-logs-example
- ClickHouse metrics: signoz://dashboard/clickhouse-schema-for-metrics and signoz://dashboard/clickhouse-metrics-example
- ClickHouse traces: signoz://dashboard/clickhouse-schema-for-traces and signoz://dashboard/clickhouse-traces-example
- PromQL: signoz://promql/instructions

Field Discovery:
- When a Query Builder field name is not already known, call signoz_get_field_keys with the widget's signal and fieldContext before composing the query; use signoz_get_field_values when observed values help verify the filter.
- Do not invent tenant-specific attributes from an example. Adapt each example to fields present in the target tenant.

One query per panel [CRITICAL]:
A panel holds exactly ONE query. Putting more than one fails backend validation (not caught by the JSON Schema): "panel must have one query". To plot multiple series or compute a formula, nest them inside that single query as one signoz/CompositeQuery, with each builder query and each formula an entry inside it. When a panel needs only one query and no formula, prefer setting that query's plugin directly (e.g. signoz/BuilderQuery) over wrapping a lone query in signoz/CompositeQuery; it is simpler and equivalent. Reserve CompositeQuery for combining multiple builder queries and/or formulas.

Legend Formatting [CRITICAL]:
- Query Builder syntax: use {{attribute_name}} placeholders that exactly match groupBy keys.
- ALWAYS set legend when groupBy is used on series-producing charts. Without legend, SigNoz shows raw query identifiers.
- Single-key example: groupBy service.name -> legend {{service.name}}
- Multi-key example: groupBy service.name and http.method -> legend {{service.name}} - {{http.method}}
- Panel rules: timeseries/graph, bar, pie, histogram require legend when the query has groupBy.
- Table panels with groupBy should usually set legend, but the columns are often self-labeling so it is recommended rather than required.
- Value/number and list panels do not need legend formatting.
- PromQL legend syntax uses labels: {{label_name}}
- ClickHouse SQL legend syntax uses result columns: {{column_name}}
- In update flows, preserve existing legends unless you are intentionally improving them.

Panel/widgets types in dashboards [CRITICAL]:
1. Bar Chart: categorical comparisons.
2. Histogram: value distribution.
3. List Chart: ranked or enumerated items.
4. Pie Chart: proportional breakdowns.
5. Table: multi-column data inspection.
6. Timeseries: time-indexed metrics.
7. Value (the "Number" panel): single aggregated metric.

Layout (concepts):
- Panels sit on a column-based grid: each panel has a position (where it starts) and a size (how wide and tall it is).
- Give charts with legends enough height that the legend stays fully visible; treat legend space as a vertical requirement.
- Keep consistent sizing within a row of similar panels, group related panels together, and don't let panels overlap.
- Use full width for tables and wide timeseries; split a row for side-by-side comparisons.
- For the exact layout fields and how a panel links to its grid position, see signoz://dashboard/instructions and this tool's JSON Schema.

Bar chart panel [CRITICAL]:
Best for: comparing discrete categories (e.g. service names, status codes), or tracking count/metric values across categories.
- Bar Chart displays frequency or aggregated values for one or more categories over time or across categories.
- It supports data from logs, traces, or metrics.
- You can configure the Y-axis unit, and optionally set "Soft Min/Max" to control vertical scale so small values aren't exaggerated.
- You can add thresholds to highlight important limits. SigNoz colors the threshold label or tints the panel background when the condition holds. It does NOT support a Grafana-style line marker.

Histogram panel [CRITICAL]:
Best for: distribution patterns, skew, and how values cluster across ranges.
- Histogram groups numeric values into buckets and displays the frequency distribution, so you can see shape, spread, and skew.
- It supports time-series inputs from logs, traces, or metrics.
- Each bar represents a numeric range rather than a discrete category; bucket count controls bin granularity, and bin width is auto-calculated unless overridden.
- Multiple series can be plotted separately or merged into a single aggregated histogram using the "merge all series into one" option.
- Configuration allows controlling number of buckets, bucket width, and series-merging behavior.

List chart panel [CRITICAL]:
Best for: unaggregated events such as errors, warnings, or individual spans.
- List Chart displays raw values as a scrollable list, ideal for presenting log lines or spans directly in a dashboard panel.
- It supports logs and traces, rendering each entry as an item in a continuous, searchable list.
- The panel provides infinite scrolling and built-in search for rapid inspection.
- No additional configuration options are available.

Pie chart panel [CRITICAL]:
Best for: categorical proportions, such as request distribution across services.
- Pie Chart displays proportional composition across categories, showing how a whole is divided among a small set of groups.
- It supports time-series inputs from logs, traces, or metrics.
- Each slice represents a category's share of the total. Relative comparison is easiest when the category count is low.
- The panel has no configuration options.

Table panel [CRITICAL]:
Best for: detailed numeric inspection, multi-field comparison, and exact values.
- Table displays data in a structured, row-and-column format, suitable for inspecting exact values across multiple fields.
- It supports time-series outputs from logs, traces, or metrics.
- Each column represents a field or aggregation, so you can compare exact values that graphical panels cannot show.
- Configuration supports assigning column units to render numeric values in readable formats (e.g., bytes, durations).

Timeseries panel [CRITICAL]:
Best for: any metric whose meaning depends on change over time, such as throughput, latency, error rate, resource consumption, or saturation.
- Timeseries Chart plots values against time to reveal trends, seasonality, spikes, degradations, and long-term patterns.
- It supports any time-series output derived from logs, traces, or metrics, and is the primary panel for operational and performance timelines.
- It renders each series as a continuous line, so you can compare services, endpoints, or resource metrics.
- Fill Gaps converts missing timestamps into zeros, useful when sparse data must be interpreted as absence of activity rather than missing samples.
- Y-axis Unit formats numerical values for readability and domain correctness (bytes, durations, percentages, counts).
- Soft Min/Max constrains the y-axis so small fluctuations aren't visually amplified or drowned out.
- Thresholds highlight limits, SLOs, warning levels, or expected baselines. SigNoz colors the threshold label or tints the panel background. It does NOT render a horizontal line at the threshold value.

Value panel [CRITICAL]:
Best for: top-level KPIs, summary statistics, or health indicators where only the final aggregated value matters, not the trend.
- Value Panel reduces a time series to a single number, such as current throughput, average latency, or error count.
- It supports logs, traces, and metrics, as long as the underlying data can be aggregated into one value.
- Configuration requires selecting the signal type, selecting the metric/log/trace source, and defining the reduction function that collapses the series into a single output.
