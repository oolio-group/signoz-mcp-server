# Plan: mcp-go v0.56.0 Upgrade & Feature Adoption

## Status
Done

## Context
We pin mcp-go v0.49.0; latest is v0.56.0. The bump is compile-safe (verified: build clean, 17/17 test packages pass) and pulls in `santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6` + `dlclark/regexp2` for schema validation. Per owner decision, all recommended feature adoptions land in a **single PR** together with the bump. SEP-414 `_meta` trace propagation is deferred to a follow-up (see Deferred).

Findings below were verified directly against the v0.56.0 module source, not just release notes.

## Approach

### A. Version bump (applied in working tree)
- `go.mod`/`go.sum`: v0.49.0 → v0.56.0. No code changes required to compile.
- `santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6` moves from indirect to direct dependency (the validation decorator imports it).

### B. Characterization tests first (before enabling any validation)
1. **Normalization audit + replay tests**: audit every internal normalization in the param helpers (`params.go`, aggregate helpers, tool handlers) — string→number, string→bool, aliases, defaults, case handling — then replay every accepted form against the advertised schema using `santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6`. Known cases: string-or-integer numeric params, the silent `query`→`filter` alias (undeclared → accepted, verified: validator ignores undeclared props when `additionalProperties` is unset), omitted `searchContext`. Replay must go through the real JSON decode path (raw wire bytes → decode → handler), not Go-constructed maps, so type behavior matches production. Any accepted-but-rejected-by-schema form is a contract defect: fix the schema (union types), not the acceptance.
2. **Schema-compiles test**: compile every registered tool's input (and output, where declared) schema. Verified in source: `inputSchemaValidator.validate` returns `(false, nil)` on compile error — a malformed schema silently disables validation for that tool. A test must make this loud. Assert an **exact expected inventory** of schema-declaring tools so a tool that accidentally never declared its schema is caught.
3. **DNS-rebinding regression test**: request over loopback listener with non-loopback Host → 403; pod-IP/localhost-Host flows unaffected.

### C. Input schema validation — always on, never rejects, in-band notice (final design 2026-07-11)
Principle constraint (agent-first): tools accept flexible input types and normalize internally; a call an agent makes "wrong" that we can normalize is a contract defect on our side, not the model's. End users reach this server through heterogeneous agents, most of which do not self-correct from rejection errors — so validation informs (telemetry + in-band notice) and never gates.

- **No configuration.** `MCP_INPUT_VALIDATION_MODE` was dropped entirely (owner decision 2026-07-11, superseding the 2026-07-10/11 tri-state designs): validation always runs, never rejects, and needs no kill switch because every layer fails open (compile failure → undecorated tool; mismatch → call served). Identical behavior on HTTP and stdio.
- **Registration-time design**: the `h.addTool` wrapper (`schema_compat.go`) — the one place that sees the final normalized schema before SDK registration — compiles the schema once and decorates the tool's handler. Per call, validate the arguments; on mismatch emit a deduplicated WARN + `mcp.tool.validation.mismatches` metric, **proceed to the handler regardless**, and append an in-band `Input validation notice:` text block to the successful result naming the mismatched path and expected type. Self-correcting agents adjust on the next call; agents that never read errors still get a served result. Mismatches on real traffic drive schema fixes (union types, alias declaration), per "contract as the defect".
- **Dependency plumbing (explicit design)**: the decorator lives on `Handler` (`internal/handler/tools/handler.go`), which already owns the logger and meters — no package-level mutable configuration. `addTool` is the method `h.addTool` (all ~41 registration sites). Schemas are compiled after `normalizeToolSchemas`, and the compiled input/output schemas are closed over in the decorated handler. **Registration-time compile failure**: register the tool fail-open (undecorated) but emit a bounded startup ERROR log + metric; the B2 CI compile/inventory test independently fails the build.
- **No rejection path exists.** Design history: 2026-07-10 shipped a tri-state (off/shadow/enforce) with decorator-owned enforce rejections on the coded-error contract; 2026-07-11 the owner first dropped the default-flip goal (heterogeneous end-user agents mostly don't self-correct from rejections), then dropped the env var and enforce/off entirely in favor of always-validate + in-band notice. Rejection stays reserved for unrecoverable intent, which handlers already implement per-field (missing required param, unusable value).
- **Validation input fidelity**: when the SDK preserves `RawArguments` (all wire traffic), the decorator validates the exact raw bytes, skipping the marshal round-trip of the decoded tree; map-constructed requests (tests) fall back to the round-trip path.
- **Telemetry hygiene**: metric attributes use normalized, bounded param paths (strip array indexes and user-controlled property names; cap length). Logs carry bounded path/keyword metadata only — **never raw argument values** (tool inputs can contain webhook passwords, API keys). Mismatch/missing-content WARNs are deduplicated per `(tool, direction, path, constraint)` key per process so a looping client cannot flood logs; counters stay exact per event.
- **Notice quality**: the appended notice must name the offending param and expected type (road to recovery); the decorator surfaces the flattened jsonschema error (`at '/limit': got boolean, want string`-style) with soft wording — the schema layer cannot know whether the handler ignored, defaulted, or normalized the value — pinned by test.
- Do **not** enable `WithStrictInputSchemaDefault()` — `additionalProperties:false` would break the silent `query` alias.
- Alignment note: the decorator validates against the exact normalized schema that is advertised (same `mcp.Tool` value passed to `AddTool`) — validator and published contract share one source, closing the advertised-schema-vs-handler-acceptance drift class.

### D. Output schemas — enumerated read-only allowlist, decorator-validated (telemetry-only)
**Validation mechanism**: output validation for allowlisted tools happens inside the same registration-time handler decorator and is telemetry-only — an output mismatch is our defect, not the caller's, so the original result always passes through (WARN + `mcp.tool.validation.mismatches` with `validation.direction=output`). The decorator is the **only** output validator (`server.WithOutputSchemaValidation()` is not used). Nil-`StructuredContent`-on-success is a deduplicated WARN + counter (fail open, never silent). Success shapes keep arrays non-nil (`results`, `available_headings`) — the generated schema types Go slices as `["null","array"]` so `null` is technically schema-valid, but `[]` is the friendlier contract for typed clients, and the allowlist test validates every success against the advertised schema.

**Allowlist (exact, derived from a full 41-tool output-shape audit — only read-only, fully code-controlled success shapes qualify):**

| Tool | Output Go type | Top-level shape | Upstream-owned nested fields | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `signoz_search_docs` | `docs.SearchResponse` | `{results[], query, total_matches}` | none | fully ours, zero upstream coupling |
| `signoz_fetch_doc` | `docs.FetchResult` | `{content, available_headings[], …}` | none | fully ours, stable |
| `signoz_check_metric_usage` | `map[string]client.MetricUsage` | `{<metric>: {dashboards[], alerts[], error?}}` | none | fully ours, small |
| `signoz_list_alerts` | `paginate.Response` w/ `[]types.Alert` | `{data[], pagination}` | none | typed, ours |
| `signoz_list_alert_rules` | `paginate.Response` w/ `[]types.AlertRuleSummary` | `{data[], pagination}` | `Labels` open map → `additionalProperties: true` | typed, ours, one open map |

Schema-generation types (exact — runtime JSON unchanged): `mcp.WithOutputSchema[paginate.Response]` would type `data` as `any[]`, so the two list tools use dedicated mirror structs, defined next to their handlers in `internal/handler/tools/alerts.go`:
- `alertListOutput struct { Data []types.Alert \`json:"data"\`; Pagination paginate.Metadata \`json:"pagination"\` }` → `mcp.WithOutputSchema[alertListOutput]()`
- `alertRuleListOutput struct { Data []types.AlertRuleSummary \`json:"data"\`; Pagination paginate.Metadata \`json:"pagination"\` }` → `mcp.WithOutputSchema[alertRuleListOutput]()`
The other three allowlisted tools use their existing payload types directly (`docs.SearchResponse`, `docs.FetchResult`, `map[string]client.MetricUsage`).

**Excluded, with rationale:**
- All mutating tools (spec says declared output schemas MUST be conformed to; notification-channel create/update deliberately return success after the mutation even when read-back/test-send fails to prevent duplicate retries — SDK/decorator validation would flip that into an error and invite duplicate creation; the trivial `{status,id}` mutation envelopes could qualify later but are excluded on the mutation rule).
- All class-(b) tools (`list_services`, `list_dashboards`, `list_views`, channel create/update): stable outer envelope but upstream-owned, drift-prone `data[]`/`channel` payloads.
- All class-(c) passthrough tools — including the four structured-but-passthrough reads (`get_dashboard`, `get_alert`, `get_view`, `get_notification_channel`, `get_trace_details`): they set `StructuredContent` today but the shape is upstream's, not ours.
- `signoz_list_dashboard_templates` (fully ours and maximally stable, but returned text-only today; migrating it to a structured result is an unrelated output change — follow-up).

**Read→write-back compatibility (independent of output schemas — the paired get tools are upstream passthrough)**: per-pair fixture/contract tests for **dashboards** (get response subobject → update's `{id, dashboard}` wrapper), **views** (get → `{id, view}` + server-owned field stripping), **alerts** (version-dependent get shapes → update payload). Each test documents: response subobject, fields to strip, required wrapper. Notification channels excluded (envelope-get vs flattened-args-update; no adapter defined).

Tests: every allowlisted tool returns non-nil `StructuredContent` on every success path; exact schema inventory (exactly these 5 tools) asserted in B2.

### E. `server.WithStreamableHTTPLogger(m.logger)` (v0.55.0)
- Route SDK transport-level errors (SSE write failures, heartbeat/session goroutines, recovered transport panics) into our slog. No overlap with tool logs.
- Test: assert transport events reach our slog handler (wiring only — exact upstream wording is the SDK's to change and is deliberately not pinned).

### F. Raw-argument precision (v0.56.0) — tests-only unless a raw-wire test proves a bug
- **Contract (owner-confirmed): numeric params intentionally accept BOTH strings and numbers** (`"50"` and `50`); strings are transformed to numbers internally. Any change here must keep that contract.
- First step: a **raw-wire precision test** — JSON bytes with >2^53 integers through the production decode path (map-constructed handler tests cannot reproduce JSON's float64 rounding). **Unless that test demonstrates a real precision bug, F ships tests-only** (characterization of the dual-acceptance contract, no decode changes).
- If a real bug is found, fix per-field only, via a flexible type (custom unmarshaller accepting string and number); no blanket `json.Decoder.UseNumber()` (flips `map[string]any` value types from `float64` to `json.Number`, breaking every existing `.(float64)`/`.(string)` assertion); no `BindArguments` into concrete integer fields (rejects numeric strings). Both-forms (`"50"`/`50`) tests for every touched param.

### Deferred (follow-up PR, not this one)
- **SEP-414 `_meta` propagation (`WithMetaPropagator`)**: extraction replaces the active span context before dispatch; our HTTP middleware starts method spans *before* extraction and hooks end them via `trace.SpanFromContext(ctx)` — with `_meta` present, hooks would end the wrong (remote, non-recording) span and leak ours. Requires consolidating method-span ownership. Too invasive for this PR.
- `server.WithTracer`/`WithPropagator`: duplicate our existing method + tool spans / otelhttp header extraction; no "method spans only" option exists (`WithTracer` force-installs its tool middleware).
- `mcp-go/otel` module: separately versioned (tagged v0.54.0, not v0.56.0); we have no OTel LoggerProvider.
- Output schemas for mutation tools: blocked on post-mutation failure-semantics redesign (see D).
- ~~Enforce-mode default flip~~ then ~~the whole `MCP_INPUT_VALIDATION_MODE` tri-state~~ **dropped 2026-07-11** (see C): validation is always on and never rejects; mismatch telemetry + in-band notices drive normalization/widening fixes.
- CORS, OAuth metadata helper, sessions/subscriptions/sampling/elicitation, `SchemaCache`, tool/prompt filters, `WithInteger` retrofits — unchanged from earlier assessment (stateless server, or we own the flow already).

## Principles alignment (internal MCP best-practices doc)
- **Accept-all-and-normalize**: always-on, never-rejecting validation (C) and the dual string/number guard (F) exist specifically so no currently-normalized agent input starts failing.
- **Contract is the defect, not the model**: validation mismatches are treated as schema bugs to fix (unions, alias declaration), not client errors.
- **Road to recovery in errors**: the in-band validation notice names the param and expected type so self-correcting agents can fix the next call without a failed turn.
- **Contract as executable promise**: validator consumes the exact advertised schema (single source); `query` alias stays accepted; read→write-back compatibility is specified per resource pair with contract tests (D).
- **Fewer, sharper tools / no token tax**: this PR adds zero tools and does not change advertised schemas except to declare already-accepted forms.

## Things that can break (checklist — verify each before merge)
1. **DNS-rebinding 403 (only default behavior change in the range)** — **RESOLVED**: deployment topology verified clean across staging + all three production clusters (single-container pod, no sidecars/mesh, ingress-nginx proxies to pod IPs, kubelet probes hit pod IP, AI assistant connects via public ingress URL). No loopback listener carries a public Host. Protection stays enabled, no opt-out flag. Local dev (localhost Host over loopback) remains allowed. Regression test in B3 guards future topology changes.
2. **Validation notices must not fire on accepted forms**: params advertised as a single type but accepting alternate forms in handlers would emit spurious notices. Union types `{"type":["string","integer"]}` verified working in jsonschema/v6; every such param must declare the union. B1 catches drift; the replay test asserts zero notices on all accepted forms; the mismatch metric catches real-traffic unknowns.
3. **Undeclared params stay accepted** (validated: `additionalProperties` unset → validator ignores extras) — but only while strict default stays OFF. Never add `WithStrictInputSchemaDefault()` without deprecating the `query` alias first.
4. **Malformed schema = silently disabled validation** for that tool (verified fail-open, no signal). B2 test + exact inventory makes it a CI failure.
5. **Validation bypasses our middleware in both directions**: input rejections produce no `execute_tool` span/log/analytics event; output validation can flip a middleware-logged success into a client-visible error. Mitigation: dedicated authoritative validation telemetry (C) + read-only output allowlist (D) + exactly-one-terminal-event tests.
6. **Output validation no-ops silently** on nil `StructuredContent`, error results, and uncompilable schemas — mitigated by runtime nil-StructuredContent signal (D), B2 compile test, exact inventory.
7. **Typed binding / decode hazards (F) — protects the intentional dual string/number input contract**: `UseNumber` flips map value types breaking type assertions; struct binding silently drops unknown/alias fields and rejects numeric strings into concrete int fields; input validation sees decoded `Params.Arguments` (float64-rounded) while `BindArguments` sees raw bytes. Raw-wire test first; tests-only unless bug proven.
8. **SDK transport logger volume**: heartbeat/session log noise at wrong levels could flood; E's level/fields test verifies mapping.
9. **New transitive deps** (`jsonschema/v6` → direct, `regexp2`): license check + binary/image-size delta vs current baseline (commands and acceptable threshold recorded in PR).
10. **Client compat (in-band notice)**: the appended `Input validation notice:` text block is additive to the result content — clients reading only `content[0]` or `StructuredContent` are unaffected; text-concatenating clients see the notice after the result. No error shape changes.
11. **Secrets in telemetry**: validation logs/metrics must never carry raw argument values or full validation payloads (webhook passwords, API keys); bounded normalized paths only.

## Files to Modify
- `go.mod`, `go.sum` — bump (done); `jsonschema/v6` becomes direct.
- `internal/config/config.go` — no changes (the earlier `MCP_INPUT_VALIDATION_MODE` was removed 2026-07-11).
- `internal/handler/tools/handler.go` — validation mode field on `Handler` (owns logger/meters already).
- `internal/handler/tools/schema_compat.go` — `addTool` → `h.addTool` method (update ~41 registration sites); registration-time schema compile + always-on validation decoration with in-band input notice.
- `internal/mcp-server/server.go` — `WithStreamableHTTPLogger`; no SDK validation options (validation is decorator-owned in `internal/handler/tools/schema_compat.go`).
- `pkg/otel/metrics.go` — `mcp.tool.validation.mismatches` / rejection metrics (bounded attrs).
- `internal/handler/tools/*` — output schemas for the read-only allowlist; nil-StructuredContent signal in `structuredResult` path (`errs.go`).
- New test files — normalization replay (raw-wire), schema-compile + inventory, DNS-rebinding regression, output success-shape, exactly-one-terminal-event, transport-logger fields, raw-wire precision.
- Docs sync per CLAUDE.md checklist: README (validation-notice behavior note), `manifest.json`, `docs/` — checked and outcome stated in PR summary. agent-skills: no taught contract changes → expected no companion PR; state outcome.

## Verification (executable gates)
- **Build/tests**: `go build ./...` && `go test ./...` — zero failures.
- **Vet**: `go vet ./...` — empty output.
- **Format** (non-mutating, tracked/non-ignored files only — plain `-l .` recurses into ignored worktrees):
  - `git ls-files -co --exclude-standard -z -- '*.go' | xargs -0 gofmt -l`
  - `git ls-files -co --exclude-standard -z -- '*.go' | xargs -0 goimports -l`
  - both must print nothing (CI equivalent: primus `fmt` job).
- **Lint**: no pinned local command in this repo — the primus **`lint`** GitHub job (`signoz/primus.workflows/go-lint.yaml`) must pass; likewise **`fmt`**, **`test`**, **`deps`**, **`build`** jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
- **Tidy**: `go mod tidy && git diff --exit-code go.mod go.sum`.
- **Race**: `go test -race ./internal/handler/tools/... ./internal/mcp-server/...` (covers registration-time schema compile cache + per-call reads).
- **License** (pinned, no install required): `go run github.com/google/go-licenses@v1.6.0 report ./... | grep -E 'jsonschema|regexp2'` — expect Apache-2.0 (`santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6`) and MIT (`dlclark/regexp2`); both acceptable.
- **Binary size** (two builds, then compare):
  - on `main`: `go build -o /tmp/mcp-main ./cmd/server`
  - on the branch: `go build -o /tmp/mcp-branch ./cmd/server`
  - `stat -f%z /tmp/mcp-main /tmp/mcp-branch`; record both in PR; acceptable delta ≤ +5 MiB.
- **Ordering**: B-tests land before C/D options are enabled in the same PR (commit ordering: tests first, then enablement).
- **Live smoke via subagent per CLAUDE.md**: copy an existing resource's shape rather than hand-crafting; never print or persist credentials; delete every created resource and confirm deletion; report which fields round-tripped. Exercise valid + deliberately invalid args on a representative tool set; confirm mismatched calls are served with an appended validation notice (never rejected) and the mismatch metric fires; confirm the notice text is LLM-actionable.
- **Observability**: `mcp.tool.validation.mismatches` and nil-StructuredContent counters visible in SigNoz.
